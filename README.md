# Principle-Component-Analysis
%all the credit for creating this problem goes to Dr. Bogdan of University of Central Lancashire
%- Thanks for increasing my interest in pattern recognition and machine learning professor.  


Learn, use and code 'discriminant analysis' for machine learning. Created a problem with 3 classes and random data in it and the
condition to resolve the problem is to, 

1. Assume Class =2 and Class =3 data as one i.e, Class 2 = Class2 + Class3 
    1.1 plot classifier 
    


2. Scale and determine perfomance of PCa and LDa using Skewness, Kurtosis. 
3. Evaluate Scatter matrix perfomance for high dimensional data and outliners
4. Evaluate whether or not this dimensionality reduction is accurate and useful for real world problem.
